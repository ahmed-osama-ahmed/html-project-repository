             <p>Everything in the full sense of the word comes under the concept of Internet of things, clothes, furniture, household utensils, body parts, streets, and various household items such as fridge, washing machine, alarms, buildings entrances and air conditioners, and the list extends to include everything from other things such as goods and products available on the shelves of shops </p>
           
            <p>Even animals! Anything that a processor and internet connection can stick to is something in the IoT world. For example, a lot of cows farms around the world are beginning to connect the bodies of cows to the Internet to monitor their health and the percentage of some hormones in their body, which indicates the best time to milk them, which contributes to making accurate decisions to improve the production process.</p>
            
            <p>The establishment of the Internet of Things system depends on the abundance of many major components, these are smart devices that support the web for the purposes of harnessing it to process data, sensors, and communications devices of various kinds to collect data from their environment and transfer it to the beneficiary. The secret of the business is that all IoT devices communicate with special sensors to capture and analyze the necessary data. Then return the important information without any human intervention, there are no special protocols for connecting to the network and web-supported devices.</p>
