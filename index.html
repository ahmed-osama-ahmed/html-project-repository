                <p>The world lived in the era of computing and desktop and personal computers, and this wave that lasted for nearly 15 years was the nature of that era. For example, Microsoft’s message at the time was “a device on every office and in every home” and it succeeded in achieving it in a way Whole. With the development of processors and screens, we moved to the era of mobility, where the appearance of the iPhone in the beginning of 2007 marked the launch of the new era of technology and the new era of computing. From that time until the moment, we carry in our pockets what can do tasks that exceed those of a huge desktop computer that sits on our offices 10 years ago.
